                    <ul>
                        <li>An applicant for postgraduate admission into ATLAS is normally expected to have a minimum of a first degree ( second class lower) for masters or HND for PGD in a related field in addition to 5 O-Level credits including English Language and Mathematics.</li>
                        <li>Additional requirements might apply for some programmes and these can be viewed after selecting the Programme and entry level at the Faculty's admission page.</li>
                        <li>To apply for a programme, select the Faculty, choose the programme so that the View Requirement button is enabled. Clicking this button will reveal the corresponding entry requirement and enable the Apply button on the pre-payment application page.</li>
                        <li>Fill in all the remaining details on the page before submitting.</li>
                        <li>On successful submission of the pre-payment form, you are redirected to Remita to obtain an RRR invoice which should be used to effect payment for the application form.</li>
                        <li>An applicant who pays online using a payment card will automatically obtain the online form which must be filled before submission.</li>
                        <li>In all cases a successful payment will lead to the generation of an online application form which should be filled before submission online. The admission process is automated and the outcome is virtually instantaneous!</li>
                        <li>Please print your form and admission letter and bring them to your chosen Study Centre for verification by an Admin Officer.</li>
